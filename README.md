# 🔒📸Laptop_physical_Intrusion_Detection 🔒📸


a Python script that utilizes computer vision and PushBullet API to enhance the security of my home. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

⭐Detection: The script uses the OpenCV library to access the webcam and capture an image when it detects an intruder.

⭐Notification: It then sends the captured image to my device using the PushBullet API, giving me an immediate alert.

⭐Action: If I receive the notification and it's not me, I can simply reply with 'No'. 

The script will then capture another image, send it, wait for 10 seconds (just in case), and then initiate a system log off.
